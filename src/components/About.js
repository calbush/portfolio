                <p className='about-text'>Hey there. I'm Caleb. I've got a passion for film & tv, photography, video games, and web development. I've also recently taken up bass guitar which has been a blast.</p>
                <p className='about-text'>I graduated with a B.A. in filmmaking from Columbia College Chicago in the Fall of 2021. After about a year of trying to find consistent work in the film industry, I realized that it wasn't the right career for me, but I still kept my passion for movies!</p>
                <p className='about-text'>I wanted to find a career where I could frequently learn on the job, utilize my problem solving skills, and still flex my creative muscles. This led me to programming.
                 I've been teaching myself for about a year and a half. I started with a very basic introductory programming course called <a href='https://www.py4e.com/' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>Python For Everybody</a>, where I got a broad overview of python and general programming fundamentals. Eventually, I discovered an open source, full stack, asynchronous web development course called <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/' rel='noreferrer' target='_blank'>The Odin Project.</a> Some of the technologies and languages I've learned are: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React, Express, MongoDB, and Git. </p>
